# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This application is a simple planner that displays the current date and allows the user to input events per hour of the business day. Events can be saved to local storage for future viewing.

The planner can be found [here](https://elisesamanthadaly.github.io/3-1-21-Homework/).


## Usage

The current day of week and date can be seen on the third line of the header.

The present hour is highlighted in red. Past hours are highlighted in grey, and future ones in green.

If the user clicks an individual hour block, they can write an event. To save the event text, click the blue save button adjacent to that event block.

The planner automatically refreshes itself every 5 minutes. This updates the timeblock highlighting, but will delete unsaved event entries.
